EV Market Segmentation Analysis (Step-7, Describing Segments)
This repository contains the EV dataset. It contains data about vehicle type, max sales volume, market share, public EV charging stations, etc.
In the Describing Segments notebook, I have performed cross-tabulation and prepared mosaic plots between cluster numbers and the descriptor variables.
The clusters are obtained through K-means algorithm.
